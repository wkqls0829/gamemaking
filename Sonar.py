            To play, enter the coordinates of the point in the ocean you wish to drop a
            sonar device. The sonar can find out how far away the closest chest is to it.
            For example, the d below marks where the device was dropped, and the 2's
            represent distances of 2 away from the device. The 4's represent
            distances of 4 away from the device.

            chests up to a distance of 9. If all chests are out of range, the point
            will be marked with O
